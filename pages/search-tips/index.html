    <h2>Use filters to narrow your search results</h2>

    <p>Once you have a set of search results, apply filters to get results that meet your criteria. Filters are the drop-down menus below the search box. You can filter your results by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Unit</b>: This is the department or bureau with a categorical exclusion.</li>
    </ul>

<!--     <h2>Sort your results</h2>

    <p>
        You can sort your search results by:
        <ul>

        <li>Soonest application deadline</li>
        <li>Latest application deadline</li>
        <li>Soonest start date</li>
        <li>Latest start date</li>
        </ul>
    </p> -->
